# PostgreSQL internals glossary

Distilled terms for the pg-claude corpus. Grown mechanically by the
`pg-corpus-maintainer` cloud routine (recipe:
`.claude/cloud/pg-corpus-maintainer.md`, Pass 2).

**Provenance.** Each entry is distilled from an existing per-file or long-form
corpus doc (named after "— via"), which carries the underlying `file:line`
verification against `source/` at the corpus's last-verified commit
(`ef6a95c7c64`, 2026-06-01). `file:line` refs are into `source/...` and stay
stable across upstream pulls. Confidence tags follow CLAUDE.md.

Entries are alphabetical (case-insensitive). One `### <term>` heading per term
so future runs can detect what's already defined and append idempotently.

### backend
A per-connection PostgreSQL server process. The postmaster forks one backend
per accepted connection; that backend runs `PostgresMain`, the "traffic cop"
read-parse-plan-execute loop, for the life of the session. Because each
session is a fresh fork, backend PIDs are not stable across connects.
[verified-by-code] (`postgres.c:4274` — via
`knowledge/files/src/backend/tcop/postgres.c.md`).

### buffer (shared buffer)
A `BLCKSZ`-sized page slot in the shared buffer pool, the cache between
backends and the storage manager. Each buffer has a fixed-size `BufferDesc`
header carrying its page identity (`tag`) and an atomic 64-bit `state` packing
refcount, usagecount, flags, and content-lock bits; pool and headers are
allocated in shared memory at startup. [verified-by-code]
(`buf_internals.h:326-359`, `buf_init.c:24-145` — via
`knowledge/subsystems/storage-buffer.md`).

### catalog (system catalog)
The set of on-disk tables (`pg_class`, `pg_proc`, `pg_type`, …) that hold all
database metadata — every relation, type, function, and operator is a row in a
catalog. The initial contents are bootstrapped from `.dat`/`.h` files via the
BKI mechanism; editing catalogs has strict OID and `catversion` rules.
[from-README] (via `knowledge/idioms/catalog-conventions.md`).

### ereport
The macro family for reporting errors and log messages, taking an elevel
(DEBUG…NOTICE…ERROR…PANIC), a SQLSTATE, and `errmsg`/`errdetail`/`errhint`
fields. `ERROR` and above do a `longjmp` to the nearest handler. Every C file
that reports errors includes `elog.h`. [verified-by-code] (via
`knowledge/files/src/include/utils/elog.h.md`).

### executor
The engine that runs a finished plan tree. Each query passes through the
`ExecutorStart` / `ExecutorRun` / `ExecutorFinish` / `ExecutorEnd` lifecycle;
`ExecutorRun` (hookable, dispatching to `standard_ExecutorRun`) pulls tuples
through the plan node tree one node at a time. [verified-by-code]
(`execMain.c:308,318` — via
`knowledge/files/src/backend/executor/execMain.c.md`).

### heap
PostgreSQL's default table access method: tuples are stored as
`HeapTupleHeader`-prefixed rows inside `BLCKSZ` pages, with old/new row
versions coexisting for MVCC. HOT (heap-only-tuple) chains and the
tuple-locking protocol — the trickier invariants — are documented in the heap
READMEs. [from-README] (`README.HOT`, `README.tuplock` — via
`knowledge/files/src/backend/access/heap/README.md`).

### HeapTuple
The lightweight in-memory wrapper for a heap row:
`struct HeapTupleData { uint32 t_len; ItemPointerData t_self; Oid t_tableOid;
HeapTupleHeader t_data; }` — a length, the row's self-TID, its table OID, and a
pointer to the on-page header. The bit-level layout lives in `htup_details.h`.
[verified-by-code] (`htup.h:62-69` — via
`knowledge/files/src/include/access/htup.h.md`).

### palloc
Context-aware memory allocation. Memory returned by `palloc` belongs to the
`CurrentMemoryContext` rather than to the caller; it can be freed individually
with `pfree` but is more usually reclaimed in bulk when its context is reset or
deleted. OOM is reported via `ereport`, never a NULL return. [from-comment]
(`palloc.h:1-9,31-52` — via
`knowledge/files/src/include/utils/palloc.h.md`).

### planner
The optimizer stage that turns a `Query` into an executable `Plan` tree.
`planner()` / `standard_planner()` drive `subquery_planner` on the top query,
enumerate and cost candidate Paths, pick the cheapest, and hand it to
`create_plan` to materialize the final plan. [verified-by-code] (via
`knowledge/files/src/backend/optimizer/plan/planner.c.md`).

### postmaster
The supervisor process. It owns the shared-memory and semaphore pools, listens
for connections, and forks a fresh backend on each accept; it deliberately
stays *out* of shared memory so a crashing backend can never corrupt the
supervisor — a load-bearing invariant of the whole process model.
[from-comment] (`postmaster.c:14-23` — via
`knowledge/files/src/backend/postmaster/postmaster.c.md`).

### relation
The internal name for any table-like object (table, index, sequence,
materialized view, composite type) — anything with a `pg_class` row and a
relfilenode. The in-memory `RelationData`/`Relation` handle caches a relation's
catalog metadata, tuple descriptor, and access-method routines. [from-README]
(via `knowledge/idioms/catalog-conventions.md`).

### snapshot
A `SnapshotData` value that captures which tuple versions a query may see. Its
`SnapshotType` selects the visibility regime — the seven types are `MVCC`,
`SELF`, `ANY`, `TOAST`, `DIRTY`, `HISTORIC_MVCC`, and `NON_VACUUMABLE` — and a
single struct is reused across table AMs instead of a per-AM callback.
[from-comment] (`snapshot.h:19-30` — via
`knowledge/files/src/include/utils/snapshot.h.md`).

### TransactionId (xid)
A 32-bit transaction identifier stamped into each tuple's xmin/xmax. Special
values include `InvalidTransactionId` (0); the 32-bit space wraps around, so
PostgreSQL also carries a 64-bit `FullTransactionId` to reason about age
without ambiguity. [verified-by-code] (`transam.h:3-4` — via
`knowledge/files/src/include/access/transam.h.md`).

### TupleTableSlot
The executor's universal tuple container, abstracting over how a tuple is
physically stored behind a `TupleTableSlotOps` vtable. Four built-in slot kinds
exist — Virtual, HeapTuple, MinimalTuple, and BufferHeapTuple — plus
extension-defined ones, letting every plan node pass tuples uniformly.
[verified-by-code] (via
`knowledge/files/src/include/executor/tuptable.h.md`).

### WAL (xlog)
The write-ahead log: every change is recorded as an XLOG record and flushed to
durable storage *before* the modified data pages are written back, which is
what makes crash recovery possible. `XLogInsertRecord` appends records on the
fast path; `StartupXLOG` replays them during recovery. [from-comment]
(`xlog.c:6-28` — via
`knowledge/files/src/backend/access/transam/xlog.c.md`).
